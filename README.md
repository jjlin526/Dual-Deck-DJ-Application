# Dual-Deck Desktop DJ Application - C++, Projucer and JUCE Framework
* A cross-platform dual-deck DJ controller was developed using multithreading and component-driven development, providing users with precise control over multiple audio signals
* Digital Signal Processing effects, such as low-pass, band-pass and high-pass frequency attenuation and equal-power crossfading, were integrated into the controller 
* The animated waveform was remodeled to allow for drag-and-drop track loading and scrubbing of audio position, with metadata display
* Hot cue markers, which allow for triggering of vocal loops and melodic notes, and user-curated queues for song scheduling were also integrated
* The library playlist was enhanced to support filtering, searching, column-based sorting, importing and exporting using XML files, individual adding and deleting of tracks, and to persist between application loads
